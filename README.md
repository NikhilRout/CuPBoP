# CuPBoP: Cuda for Parallelized and Broad-range Processors

## Simplified/Added `cupbop-compile` for me
`cupbop-compile.sh` sets up path, sources environment and runs all compilation commands. To run cuda files now
```bash
cd cuda_projects/matmul
cupbop-compile matmul.cu
./matmul_wrapper
```

## Introduction

CuPBoP is a framework which support executing unmodified CUDA source code
on non-NVIDIA devices.
Currently, CuPBoP support serveral CPU backends, including x86, AArch64, and RISC-V.
Supporting [Vortex](https://vortex.cc.gatech.edu/) (a RISC-V GPU) is working in progress.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- Linux system
- [LLVM 14.0.1](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-14.0.1)
- CUDA Toolkit

Although CuPBoP does not require NVIDIA GPUs,
it needs CUDA to compile the source programs to NVVM/LLVM IRs.
CUDA toolkit can be built on machines without NVIDIA GPUs.
For building CUDA toolkit, please refer to <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>.

### Installation

1. Clone from github

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/cupbop/CuPBoP
   cd CuPBoP
   export CuPBoP_PATH=`pwd`
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CuPBoP_PATH/build/runtime:$CuPBoP_PATH/build/runtime/threadPool:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   export CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.7 # set to your own location
   ```

2. Build CuPBoP

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   #set -DDEBUG=ON for debugging
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. (Optional) Use CuPBoP to execute Hetero-mark benchmark for verification

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Run Vector Addition example

In this section, we provide an example of how to use CuPBoP to execute a CUDA program.

```bash
cd examples/vecadd
# Compile CUDA source code (both host and kernel) to bitcode files
clang++ -std=c++11 vecadd.cu \
      -I../.. --cuda-path=$CUDA_PATH \
      --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_50 -L$CUDA_PATH/lib64 \
      -lcudart_static -ldl -lrt -pthread -save-temps -v  || true
# Apply compilation transformations on the kernel bitcode file
$CuPBoP_PATH/build/compilation/kernelTranslator \
      vecadd-cuda-nvptx64-nvidia-cuda-sm_50.bc kernel.bc
# Apply compilation transformations on the host bitcode file
$CuPBoP_PATH/build/compilation/hostTranslator \
      vecadd-host-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.bc host.bc
# Generate object files
llc --relocation-model=pic --filetype=obj  kernel.bc
llc --relocation-model=pic --filetype=obj  host.bc
# Link with runtime libraries and generate the executable file
g++ -o vecadd -fPIC -no-pie \
      -I$CuPBoP_PATH/runtime/threadPool/include \
      -L$CuPBoP_PATH/build/runtime  \
      -L$CuPBoP_PATH/build/runtime/threadPool \
      host.o kernel.o \
      -I../.. -lc -lCPUruntime -lthreadPool -lpthread
# Execute
./vecadd
```
